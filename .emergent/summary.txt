<analysis>**original_problem_statement:**
The user wants to build a modern website for their painting company, Ocean Color, based in Hamburg, Germany. The primary goals are to generate qualified leads through an interactive price calculator and to encourage users to request a callback rather than calling directly.

**PRODUCT REQUIREMENTS:**
- **Website Pages:** Home, Services, Price Calculator, References, About Us, Contact, and Legal (Impressum, Datenschutz).
- **Design:** A modern, high-quality, mobile-first design with a dark blue and white color scheme and a subtle accent color.
- **Core Feature (Price Calculator):** A multi-step form where users input project details (e.g., property type, services needed, size, condition). The system calculates a price range and prompts the user to submit their contact information for a callback.
- **Backend & Database:**
    - Store all lead data from the calculator in a MongoDB database.
    - Implement file uploads for users to attach photos to their requests.
    - Send a structured email notification to the admin for each new lead.
- **Admin Dashboard:** A password-protected area () for the company owner to:
    - Log in securely.
    - View, search, and filter all leads.
    - See detailed information for each lead, including uploaded photos.
    - Change the status of a lead.
    - Manage the pricing rules used by the calculator.
- **Email Integration:** Use IONOS SMTP servers to send real-time email notifications for new leads.

**User's preferred language**: German. The next agent MUST respond in German.

**what currently exists?**
A full-stack application with a React frontend and FastAPI backend is in place. All core website pages (Home, Services, Price Calculator, References, About, Contact, Legal) are complete. The price calculator is highly functional, distinguishing between wall/ceiling work and floor work with specialized questions. The backend successfully saves leads to MongoDB, handles file uploads, calculates prices, and sends working email notifications via IONOS SMTP.

The admin dashboard () is fully functional, including secure login, lead management (list, detail view, status updates, notes), and a page for managing pricing rules. The legal pages have been updated with real company data. A References page has been built and populated with 11 projects provided by the user.
