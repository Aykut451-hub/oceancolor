**what currently exists?**
The project is a full-stack React/FastAPI application. In this session, the agent completed a major UI/UX overhaul, implementing scroll-reveal animations, button micro-interactions, and a completely redesigned two-column price calculator (). Following this, the agent integrated 12 user-provided service images across the website, creating a reusable component () with lazy loading, SEO alt-texts, and hover effects. Finally, a series of user-requested fixes were implemented, including adjusting the calculator's header image position, improving the homepage text, and correcting image placements on service pages. The application is stable and has been thoroughly tested.

**Last working item**:
- **Last item agent was working**: The user requested three final UI/UX enhancements to further polish the site's premium feel.
- **Status**: NOT STARTED
- **Agent Testing Done**: N
- **Which testing method agent to use?**: frontend testing agent. The task involves sitewide UI changes. The agent should verify the new hover effects on service cards, the click animations in the calculator, and confirm that there are no performance regressions or visual glitches on desktop and mobile.
- **User Testing Done**: N

**All Pending/In progress Issue list**:
-   **Issue 1:** Implement Final UI Enhancements (P0)

**Issues Detail:**
-   **Issue 1:** Implement Final UI Enhancements

    -   **Next debug checklist**:
        1.  **Modern Hover Effects:** Edit  and its component styles to add more advanced hover effects to the service cards (e.g., gradient borders, subtle 3D transforms, or overlay with text).
        2.  **Calculator Click Animations:** Edit . On the selection cards (like Altbau or service types), add a visual confirmation animation on click, such as a pulse or ripple effect, to make the interaction more satisfying.
        3.  **Mobile View Test:** After implementing the effects, use the screenshot tool to perform a comprehensive check on a mobile viewport. Ensure the animations are smooth, not jarring, and do not negatively impact usability on smaller screens.
